City of Chicago -- Crimes Dataset

***************

I first used the 2013 Crime dataset as a subset of the entire (2001 - Present) dataset.

	2013 Crime Dataset:

	- There are 306356 crimes (in the 2001 - Present file, there are over 5 million crimes, making using cluster comupting like Spark necessary)

Things that I can possibly do:

	1. Make a beautiful heat map of crime distributions in Chicago
